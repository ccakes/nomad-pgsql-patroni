# nomad-pgsql-patroni

A simple container running Postgres and Patroni useful for dropping directly into a Hashicorp environment (Nomad + Consul + Vault)

It also comes pre-baked with some tools and extensions

### A note about TimescaleDB and Postgres 13

Timescale didn't initially support Postgre 13 so the 13.0 and 13.1 builds didn't provide it. Timescale 2.1.0 adds Postgres 13 support so from 13.2 this image includes Timescale again!

### Running another version of Postgres?

See the [`pg-11`](https://github.com/ccakes/nomad-pgsql-patroni/tree/pg-11) or [`pg-12`](https://github.com/ccakes/nomad-pgsql-patroni/tree/pg-12) branch for older versions. Otherwise, jump to [`master`](https://github.com/ccakes/nomad-pgsql-patroni) for the latest and greatest!

## Usage

```hcl
job "postgres-13" {
  type = "service"
  datacenters = ["dc1"]

  group "group" {
    count = 1

    network {
      port api { to = 8080 }
      port pg { to = 5432 }
    }

    task "db" {
      driver = "docker"

      template {
        data = <<EOL
scope: postgres
name: pg-{{env "node.unique.name"}}
namespace: /nomad

restapi:
  listen: 0.0.0.0:{{env "NOMAD_PORT_api"}}
  connect_address: {{env "NOMAD_ADDR_api"}}

consul:
host: localhost
register_service: true

# bootstrap config
EOL

        destination = "/secrets/patroni.yml"
      }

      config {
        image = "ccakes/nomad-pgsql-patroni:13.5-1.tsdb_gis"

        ports = ["api", "pg"]
      }

      resources {
        memory = 1024
      }
    }
  }
}

```

## Testing

An example `docker-compose` file and patroni config is included to see this running.
```shell
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up
```

## ISSUES

Postgres runs as the postgres user however that user has been added to the root group. This probably has some security ramifications that I haven't thought of, but it's required for postgres to read TLS keys generated by Vault and written as templates.

[hashicorp/nomad#5020](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad/issues/5020) is tracking (hopefully) a fix for this.
